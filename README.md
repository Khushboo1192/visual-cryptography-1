# Visual Cryptography Toolkit (fork of)

"Visual Cryptography Toolkit" (vcf) is a python script I found on https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/vck/. It had some bugs that were incompatible with current versions of the dependencies, I have fixed those and published my work here.   

## Installation

You need Python 2 and Pillow.

## Usage

See other files in this repository, all copied from the original author.

## Python 3

I might port it to Python 3 in the future. Feel free to submit a pull request!
